# MNIST Digit Classification

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset in machine learning, consisting of grayscale images of digits from 0 to 9.

## Dataset Overview
- **Training Set**: 60,000 images
- **Test Set**: 10,000 images
- Each image is 28x28 pixels, grayscale.
- Labels range from 0 to 9.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model comprises:
1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial features from input images.
2. **Pooling Layers**: Downsample feature maps to reduce spatial dimensions.
3. **Dropout Layers**: Prevent overfitting.
4. **Fully Connected Layers**: Perform final classification using a softmax activation.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn

Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```

### Running the Code
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mnist-classification.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd mnist-classification
    ```
3. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python mnist_model.py
    ```

## Results
- **Test Accuracy**: [Enter obtained accuracy here]
- **Test Loss**: [Enter obtained loss here]

## Metrics and Evaluation
The model was evaluated using:
1. **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes misclassifications for each digit.
2. **Classification Report**:
    - **Precision**: Percentage of correct positive predictions.
    - **Recall**: Percentage of true positives identified.
    - **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Example Confusion Matrix:
```text
[[980   0   0   1   0   0   1   0   1   0]
 [  0 1132   1   0   0   0   1   0   1   0]
 [...]]
```

## Visualization
### Training Progress
- **Accuracy and Loss** over epochs are plotted to monitor performance.

### Predictions
- Example predictions are displayed with their corresponding true labels.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with deeper architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
- Data augmentation (rotation, scaling, flipping) to improve generalization.
- Model deployment as a web or mobile application.
